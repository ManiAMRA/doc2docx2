Sub ConvertDocToDocx()
    Dim FolderPath As String
    Dim FileName As String
    Dim docFile As Object
    Dim docApp As Object
    
    ' Specify the folder path where the .doc files are located
    FolderPath = Application.ActiveWorkbook.Path & "\"
    
   
    ' Create a new instance of Microsoft Word application
    Set WordApp = CreateObject("Word.Application")
    
    ' Disable Word Application alerts (e.g., conversion prompt)
    WordApp.DisplayAlerts = False
    

    
    ' Loop through each file in the folder
    FileName = Dir(FolderPath & "*.doc")
    Do While FileName <> ""
        If Right(FileName, 4) = ".doc" Then ' Check if the file is a .doc file
            ' Open the .doc file
            Set WordDoc = WordApp.Documents.Open(FolderPath & FileName)
            
            ' Save as .docx format
            WordDoc.SaveAs2 FolderPath & Left(FileName, Len(FileName) - 4) & ".docx", 16 ' wdFormatDocumentDefault
            
            ' Close the file
            WordDoc.Close
        End If
        
        ' Move to the next file
        FileName = Dir
    Loop
    
    MsgBox "Conversion completed!"
End Sub

Take a backup of the doc files and save this excel to the directory where the doc files are available.
